#Basically in this exercise we will be focusing on leaving our main branch alone which is the Master branch and everytime we want to edit or try something new we can just create a new branch. The way it works is that let's say I make a new branch and like the way the new branch works, I can just merge it with the master branch. This will also help when it's more than one person working on the project. Because we can have the main branch and then have 3 people working on seperate branches and merge them wheneve we want.
So  now we will start a new branch hopefully and work on that
Now I know that my changes are saved in a hidden directory git.
So now we the system knows my name and my email so when changes are made it will know that me : jad hayek is making the changes.
# we just made a little changes and took a nd snapshot
